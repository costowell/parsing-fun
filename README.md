# Parsing Fun!

Parsing is cool! I want to understand it better by implementing a few of these algorithms.

## Implementation

### Why golang?

I'm writing a [compiler in C](https://github.com/costowell/dumlang). 
Once all the helper functions and "low level code" is in place, writing C is fine, but there is undoubtedly an increased cognitive load having to consider it all.
Go is all the things I wish C had while still resembling C.

Also I want hashmaps without grabbing a random header file from the internet.
